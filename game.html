				The buttons below let you place different objects onto the map. You can either click or click and drag
				to place. Roads (blue) are faster to travel on, mountains (light grey) are slower to travel on, and
				walls (dark grey) can't be traveled on. Click the radio buttons to change the heuristic used by the
				algorithm. For the roads/mountains to properly work, the heuristic must be set to something other than
				Manhattan. Click the Play button to actually start the algorithm. Clicking on the map while playing will
				move the player (green). The numbers in each cell represent the cost of moving to that cell. The path
				will be displayed in blue.
